            <h3>1. Residential Home Transformation</h3>
            <p>We transformed this mid-century home into a modern sanctuary with an open floor plan and sleek finishes. The design focused on maximizing natural light and creating a space that is both functional and stylish.</p>

            <h3>2. Commercial Office Redesign</h3>
            <p>For a local business, we redesigned their office space to improve productivity and collaboration. The new design features modern furniture, ergonomic workspaces, and a cohesive color scheme that promotes creativity and comfort.</p>
